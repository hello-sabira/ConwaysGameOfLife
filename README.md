# Conway's Game Of Life
A single class containing a simple implementation of Conway's game of life in Java. </br>

<h3>What is Game of Life?</h3>
In short, it is a single player game devised by British Mathematician John Conway, that simulates the birth and death of cells on a rectangular grid. 
The state of a given cell in any generation depends on the state of the cell and its eight immediate neighbors in the preceding generation, according to some simple rules: </br>
</br>
<li><i>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</i></li>
<li><i>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</i></li>
<li><i>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</i></li>
<li><i>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</i></li>

<h3>How to play or run this code</h3>
1. You can copy the code and run it in your system. It's just a single class with no fancy stuff, so nothing to worry about.</br>
2. You can download the JAR file and just double click, sit back and enjoy the view. 
</br>
In either case, it will look something like this:</br>
